Notes:
The Directory Log!

4th May 2022:
The Directory is cleaned after PlotGenerator
Three Major Directories : 
    * Classifier : Deals with Building Machine Learning Models for Trigger
    * Graph Generator : Kinematic Variable Distribution Plots using PyROOT.
        * Plots Directory has 4 sub-directories:
            * Balanced Sample - Normalized
            * Canvas - General Plot Canvas of all Kinematic Variables.
            * Classifier Plots - Shows the results from Classifier Built. Includes-ConfusionMatrix,FeatureImportance,etc.
            * Data - Shows 10% plots of entire data and its charecteristics.
        * PlotScript generate plots using the PlotGenerator.py Module.
        * OldData Notebook generates plots of Run2 data.
    * Torch : This directory move from ML based models to DL based architecture.
